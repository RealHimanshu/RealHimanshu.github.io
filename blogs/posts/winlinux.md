# Why I ditched Windows for Linux

I have been working on Linux for quite some time and I know it has become the _System of choice_ for me. I've been a Windows user before that and since last few years, I'm really disappointed by what Microsoft has come up with. So, one day, I installed Linux on my primary work computer and I never looked back to Windows since then.

I won't try to start any debate or go like _duhhhhhhhh, use Linux, I'ts the Master Race_ or something like that. I'm just going to list a few reasons why I left Windows and settled with Linux.

## 1. I don't want **all** of the Windows' programs

When you install Windows, it gives you something more than just an Operating System. There are a lot of Windows apps that are going to be installed on your computer by default. These unwanted programs generally are called Bloatware, but we're not catcalling Microsoft for making us pay for Bloatware. Though you can just uninstall these programs but they're going to be back on your computer as soon as you update your Windows.

Thanks, Microsoft, but I don't wanna try a 90-minute demo of Minecraft.

## 2. It's ssssslllllloooooowwww

Again, I'm not trying to prove Linux as a superior OS, but the one thing I didn't like about Windows is that you cannot choose what programs and what services you would like to run in the background and when you try to *kill* those processes, the OS decides to put them back up again. In contrast to this, you actually can get rid of background processes for once and for all in Linux.

Another reason behind Linux being faster is the filesystem. Linux operating systems run on the ext* family while Windows systems use NTFS. I'm not going into a detail about both of them, but the significant difference between these two filesystems is that the ext* systems are less fragmented. Talking about the results, I get around 70-90 MBPS of copying speed on my Linux computer compared to the 55-60 MBPS on Windows.

Here are the screenshots of the build times of my application on both Linux and Windows environments.

## 3. Support

Let me tell you a joke.

A man was flying a helicopter in foggy weather and got lost. After several hours of wandering, he came by a tall building. He hovered his helicopter close to that building and wrote "*where am I?*" on his notepad. The people working inside that building wrote "*in a helicopter*" on whatever they had. The man smiled and managed to land the helicopter at a helipad within a minute. When he was asked about how did he do that, he simply answered; "*the answer of the guys in that building was technically correct but practically useless. So I knew that I was at the Microsoft's Office*".

I guess this explains all.

## 4. Flavors

One thing I really like about the Linux systems is that they come in different flavors. [This simple Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+flavors) suggests that there are 50+ popular versions of Linux that you can install right now on your computer, and about a lot more are being uploaded to [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/) daily. There is an ocean of different Linux operating systems that can be used for Software Development, IoT, Production Servers and personal use, each providing a whole different toolset and other features. Although Windows also comes with the server and personal versions, but it's pretty much the same thing.

## 5. Visual Customization

What's the point of owning a Personal Computer if you don't have personalization options that you can use to customize the look and feel of the computer to make it look like really yours?

The Windows layout and look and feel have been really simple since the era of Windows 95 and it's still keeping up the trend. The latest installment of Windows OS, the Windows 10 has a limited number of customization options. All you can do is change the position of the taskbar, change the accent colors and change the desktop wallpaper. Though, some external tools like [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) can be installed on Windows to explore more customization options.

Linux, on the other hand, has a ton of distributions made on the top of GTK that uses simple CSS rules to control the look of the operating system. Ubuntu, for example, runs on Gone Shell which is a GTK3 Desktop Environment and has a lot of customization possibilities.

I personally use a MacOS theme because I like things to be neat and clean. Plus, there a whole [subreddit dedicated to the customization of Linux computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). I'd really suggest to check that out.

These were the few of many reasons that made me switch over to Linux. I can go about it all but I'm keeping this article short (while trying not be passive aggressive against Microsoft).

There are many more reasons to keep Windows. I like to play games a lot and I produce music in my free time, in this type of situations, Linux won't get me anywhere, I'll have to use Windows for these things and at the end of the day, the requirements and the efficiency are the key points that help a person decide their OS of choice.
